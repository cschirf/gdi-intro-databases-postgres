Intro to Databases (Focus on Relational Databases)
=====================================================

This material was originally developed by Heather Wade, with Class 1 Data Modeling material adapted from Pamela Fox's one day workshop. Reworked for PostgreSQL by Courtney Lenna Schirf.

The course is meant to be taught in a two four-hour classes.

## Suggested course description is below:

A database is an organized collection of data. In this class, we will discuss the science (and art) of storing and retrieving data. As anyone who has tried to analyze data using Excel can attest, it is not as simple as it might seem.

Are you a developer (web or otherwise) and wish to learn more about the backend stack? Are you a support professional looking to enter a more technical track? Are you an analyst who would like to learn how your reports get run? Are you a business owner or hobbyist who'd like to design your own database system? Or maybe you're thinking about becoming a database professional? If you answered yes to any of the questions above or are just generally interested in learning more about databases - this class will get you started!

This eight hour course runs on Saturday and Sunday:

* Class 1 - Intro to Data Modeling
* Class 2 - Intro to SQL, Reading Data
* Class 3 - Creating, Reading and Updating Tables
* Class 4 - Joins and Advanced Topics

Please bring a laptop you feel comfortable using.
